# Class 11: Server-side templating with EJS


## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Full-stack application skeleton scaffolding
- Server-side templating
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:
- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application 
- Create a schema to model data and persist the data in a SQL database
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library

## Discuss

Reply to this discussion with a quiz question to test your classmatesâ€™ knowledge of the readings. Alternatively, if you found yourself curious or found a topic unclear, ask a question to further your own knowledge. Then review your classmates' responses and answer one of their questions. If you are the first student to post a question, you do not need to go back and answer a question.
