Class 14: Google Books API

## Overview

Today is the final buildout of the book collection app. Our final step is to incorporate the Google Books API so a new book can be added to your collection and persisted in your database.

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 14 of Code 301, students will:
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Persist search results in their existing SQL database

# Readings

- Reference: [Google Books API Docs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes) - Specifically the section about working with Volumes. Review the sample request and response. Practice making requests using Postman and consider the possible properties of the response that you may want to include in your book application.

## Discuss

Reply to this discussion with a quiz question to test your classmatesâ€™ knowledge of the readings. Alternatively, if you found yourself curious or found a topic unclear, ask a question to further your own knowledge. Then review your classmates' responses and answer one of their questions. If you are the first student to post a question, you do not need to go back and answer a question.
